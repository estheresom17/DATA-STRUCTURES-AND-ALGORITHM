## Emergency Room Simulation - List-Based vs. Priority Queue-Based System

This project simulates an Emergency Room (ER) system where patients arrive and are treated based on two different data structures: a **List** (First Come, First Served) and a **Priority Queue** (Severity-based treatment). 

### Key Features:
- **Patient Generation**: Random patients with names and (in the case of the priority queue) severity levels are created.
- **List-Based ER**: Patients are treated in the order they arrive (FIFO).
- **Priority Queue-Based ER**: Patients are treated based on their severity (highest priority first).
- **Performance Tracking**: Time taken for patient insertion and treatment is measured and summarized.

### Objective:
To compare the performance of two different data structures (List and Priority Queue) in handling a dynamic patient treatment system. The simulation runs for a set amount of time, treating patients and summarizing performance.
